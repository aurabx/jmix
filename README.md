## What is JMIX?

**JMIX (JSON Medical Imaging Exchange)** is an open, structured specification for the secure, portable, and auditable exchange of medical imaging and related metadata. It addresses the limitations of traditional DICOM-based workflows in distributed, cloud-native, and privacy-sensitive environments.

JMIX is:

- A vendor-neutral packaging format for imaging payloads (e.g., DICOM, NIfTI, PDFs)
- JSON-native and human-readable
- Secure-by-design with support for encryption, digital signatures, and audit trails
- Designed to work over APIs, queues, cloud object storage, and legacy transports (e.g., HL7)

---

## Why JMIX?

Healthcare workflows increasingly require:

- Cross-organisation and cross-border imaging exchange  
- Consent-aware and privacy-compliant transport  
- Streaming, indexing, and introspection without parsing full DICOM files  
- Support for modern tooling, including FHIR, S3, Kafka, and Web APIs

JMIX makes this possible by defining a portable envelope with well-structured metadata and clear implementation semantics.

## Getting Started

To start using JMIX:

1. Explore the [Envelope Structure](./spec/envelope.md)
2. Review the [Manifest Format](./spec/envelope//manifest.md)
. Browse [Examples](./examples/)

If you're implementing support for JMIX in your application, start with the `manifest.json` schema and sample envelopes.
